A modern, responsive web application designed to solve the physical-world problem of lost and found items on university campuses.

## Development Journey
As a first-year CSE student, my goal was to conceptualize the core product requirements (CRUD operations, search functionality, admin controls) and quickly bring the idea to life. I acted as the product architect, writing detailed system prompts, while leveraging AI-assisted rapid prototyping to build out the React frontend and Node.js backend infrastructure. 

## Technical Architecture
* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
